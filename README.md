Hey and welcome.

This is an introduction to my first website.

I will make a recipe website focused on indian/pakistani food.

I hope you'll enjoy reading this.

My goal for this website is to have a basic knowledge of HTML5, and work my way around the linux command line.

After finishing this website, I aim to have brain knowledge about HTML5 and the Linux system.
